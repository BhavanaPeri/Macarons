Macarons are a traditional french snack or desert (depends upon us) 
which are made up of almond flour and meringue. It tempts children and most of adults who are 
not that sweet-toothed and often avoid goodies they can be made in desired shapes and tasteful
colours and a vare variety of flavours based on our taste palette . They give us a 
scrumbdiddlumptious taste when we dig into a mouthfull of them they first feel hard outside and
soft inside and then comes the filling like in sandwiched cookies with amazing flavours. 
In other words they can also be called as sandwiched meringue which are egg-whites beaten until
 soft peaks. They make a hand in glove with coffee or tea during teatime on a busy weekday and 
 a perfect present for a sweet-toothed person . They are commonly found in flavours of chocolate,
coffee, strawberry, mint, orange, coconut & many more. We can experience a lot of textures and 
feelings while munching on this goodie.
